# user-login-test

A demo project developed to showcase my technical background in iOS development. This application is built using Swift and UIKit, following a custom MVVM architecture with reactive programming using RxSwift.

### Prerequisites

The project has CocoaPod dependencies found in the podfile. Cocoapods needs to be installed on the macOS machine and do a pod install via the terminal.
